<hr/>
<a name=4></a>A good day to be a Berkman Fellow<br/>On any particular Tuesday morning in the spring semester of 2015, in the Victorian&#160;<br/>house the Berkman Center shares with a handful of other Harvard organizations, you&#160;<br/>would have been likely to find Berkman Fellows hanging out in one of the rather small&#160;<br/>public areas, laptops open and earbuds plugged in, or talking with other fellows in the&#160;<br/>kitchen or lounge area. Others might be working at home, attending a class or event at&#160;<br/>the University, or enjoying Cambridge — especially if the Tuesday was after this winter’s&#160;<br/>epic high tide of snow had ebbed.<br/>
At noon the fellows gather for the Tuesday talk, usually featuring a guest or a fellow.&#160;<br/>The attendees from the Center and the community routinely overflow into the Center’s&#160;<br/>small lounge. Attendees try to finish the lunch the Center provides before the speaker&#160;<br/>throws the session open for discussion.<br/>
At two o’clock, the fellows assemble for the only regularly scheduled time for all of them&#160;<br/>to be alone together. The format varies, and the discussions are usually spirited.<br/>
At four, the fellows drift into smaller informal groups. Some go back to their individual&#160;<br/>work or to the collaborative projects at the center of their fellowships. It’s quite possible&#160;<br/>that an email has been sent to their mailing list inviting any and all to assemble for a&#160;<br/>meal at a local restaurant or, increasingly commonly, at the one of fellows’ homes where&#160;<br/>a meal will be prepared, usually collaboratively.<br/>
At the end of the day, the fellows will have worked at their own paces, had lively conver-<br/>sations with colleagues, been stimulated by a talk from an expert likely out of their own&#160;<br/>field, engaged in cross-disciplinary discussions in a group of the whole, discovered a&#160;<br/>new shop or pub in Harvard Square, deepened social bonds at an informal dinner, and&#160;<br/>been stretched in purposeful and serendipitous ways.<br/>

Fifteen Lessons from the Berkman Fellows Program<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5></a>Aims and&#160;plan&#160;of this report<br/>This report was funded by the Ford Foundation, long a supporter of Berkman Center&#160;<br/>programs and events, to explore what makes the Berkman Fellows program successful.&#160;<br/>The aim is to derive lessons that can be applied to other institutions.&#160;<br/>
We approached writing this report as a journalistic task, interviewing a cross-section of&#160;<br/>fellows, faculty, and staff, including during a group session at a Berkman Fellows Hour.&#160;<br/>From these interviews a remarkably consistent set of themes emerged.<br/>
The Fellows program has evolved over time. We focused on the current state of the&#160;<br/>program in this report, using past experiences only to illuminate success factors and&#160;<br/>opportunities for growth.<br/>
It was written by David Weinberger—a former fellow (2004-2009) and current senior&#160;<br/>researcher at the Center, and member of its Fellows Advisory Board—with the active&#160;<br/>collaboration of Berkman staff, fellows, and faculty.<br/>

<hr/>
<a name=16></a><b>Don’t select fellows.</b><br/>
<b>1&#160;Select a community.</b><br/>
Having moved well past the “Island of Misfit Toys” phase in which fellows were gen-<br/>erally invited to apply, the Center takes extraordinary care to choose from among the&#160;<br/>hundreds of applicants. There are far more qualified applicants than positions. So the&#160;<br/>Center selects not just individuals but a community.<br/>
This means working extraordinarily hard to bring together a diverse group of people&#160;<br/>who will learn from one another, collaborate in unexpected ways, and who are likely to&#160;<br/>feel a strong commitment to the success of the others in their cohort.&#160;<br/>
Tabasky notes that selecting a community means that every year’s cohort is different in&#160;<br/>interests and style, even though about half of the fellows are continuing from the prior&#160;<br/>year. “Every fall we have a little bit of an identity crisis,” she says lightly, adding that&#160;<br/>that’s a healthy thing, an opportunity to learn and grow.<br/>
<b>2&#160;Cultivate the culture</b><br/>
“We’re a human network first and foremost,” says Amar Ashar, Manager of Strategic&#160;<br/>Initiatives, echoing a sentiment commonly expressed at the Center.&#160;<br/>
If so, then, as Executive Director Gasser asks, “How do you create a protocol, a culture,&#160;<br/>a spirit that puts the emphasis on being open, being kind, being good listeners, being&#160;<br/>engaged, being willing to learn from one another?”<br/>
Former Managing Director Colin Maclay attributes the initiation of this “warm and sup-<br/>portive” culture to its origins: “Charlie [Nesson] and JZ [Zittrain] dropped in some really&#160;<br/>valuable DNA. JP [John Palfrey] also set the tone.” (Others credit Maclay’s role as well.)&#160;<br/>Prof. Zittrain agrees: “I guess it starts with a few nice apples. Whatever you’d say about&#160;<br/>our early principal players, they’re all really nice. Terry [Fisher] is a nice guy. Charlie’s a&#160;<br/>nice guy.” He adds, “There’s a sense of play, which is for lols, not lulz.” (Translation from&#160;<br/>Geek: it’s for fun, not at the expense of others.)<br/>
Certainly the screening of applicants for those who work well in communities contrib-<br/>utes to the positive culture.<br/>
As with everything else, there is a balance to be struck. While fellow Primavera De&#160;<br/>Filippi says that despite Harvard’s reputation among some, “Berkman is an extremely&#160;<br/>friendly academic environment,” some fellows think that it can veer into being too kind.&#160;<br/>For example, former fellow Kit Walsh says, “There was a time when people were being&#160;<br/>
16<br/>
Fifteen Lessons from the Berkman Fellows Program<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=17></a>too nice to guests who were presenting what they were working on. The real criticism,&#160;<br/>constructive criticism, would happen at dinner after Fellows Hour, and the speaker&#160;<br/>might not get the benefit of that.”&#160;<br/>
How does the Center maintain this culture?<br/>
It selects for it.<br/>
The cohort moderates itself. For&#160;<br/>example, on rare occasions, one&#160;<br/>
It consciously communicates this to&#160;<br/>
fellow may take another aside and&#160;<br/>
incoming fellows, especially at the&#160;<br/>
suggest that a fellow’s perceived&#160;<br/>

<b>3&#160;Transfer the knowledge</b><br/>
Many of the fellows are at the Center for one year, although some remain longer as&#160;<br/>fellows or may transition into an active faculty associate or affiliate role. Despite this,&#160;<br/>explicit steps have to be taken to transfer knowledge and culture.<br/>
First is setting expectations even before the new fellows arrive. Rebecca Tabasky says:&#160;<br/>
“We share information upfront and in different ways—in our call for applications, during&#160;<br/>interviews, in our offer letters, and during our orientation and onboarding activities—<br/>about what people can expect from the Center during their fellowship, whether it’s&#160;<br/>about our support of their individual research, opportunities for collaborations, access&#160;<br/>to Harvard resources, or information about tangible benefits like office space or fund-<br/>ing.”<br/>
At least as important in setting expectations, she says, is letting applicants know that&#160;<br/>while they should expect deep rich conversation, if a topic they think is important is not&#160;<br/>being discussed they are responsible for making those discussions happen. Indeed,&#160;<br/>Tabasky stresses, fellows need to feel ownership of their experience at the Center.<br/>

The first Fellows Hours are traditionally spent on introductions of both new and return-<br/>ing fellows and their work, as well as deliberate socializing, conversation, and planning&#160;<br/>about the mode of community activities and what people want to do alone and together.<br/>
Throughout the year, the staff checks in with the fellows, and does much guiding, advis-<br/>ing, and wrangling. The faculty also make themselves available for advice and conversa-<br/>tion.<br/>
The continuing projects and research initiatives provide models from which incoming&#160;<br/>fellows can learn the approaches, processes, pedagogy, and research design typical&#160;<br/>of the Center. In fact, several interviewees stressed the importance of those continu-<br/>ing institutional projects for the success of the Fellows Program. Incoming fellows are&#160;<br/>put into an environment where faculty and other scholars are engaged in high-quality&#160;<br/>research. That context is not something that has to be reinvented every year.<br/>
Still, when Community Manager Tabasky says, “The Center attracts people who are&#160;<br/>natural leaders. The job of the Center is to get out of the way,” that’s both true and a&#160;<br/>humble diversion from the serious investment in time the Center makes in helping the&#160;<br/>cohort to form a community of researchers.<br/>
18<br/>
Fifteen Lessons from the Berkman Fellows Program<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=19></a><b>Aim for a cohesive&#160;</b><br/>
<b>4</b><br/>
<b>diversity</b><br/>
The Center is committed to diversity not only as a matter of basic fairness, but for in-<br/>tensely pragmatic reasons as well.&#160;<br/>
“We’d been working on diversity for a while,” says Colin Maclay. “If you’re in Law and&#160;<br/>Technology, you’re in white male dominated fields.” The effort intensified in 2009 as the&#160;<br/>Fellows Program scaled up.&#160;<br/>
Because, as is commonly the case, the applicant pool does not itself represent diversity&#160;<br/>across all factors, the Center tries to enlarge the pool by both broad and targeted out-<br/>reach. The broad outreach consists of public calls on the website, through the Center’s&#160;<br/>networks, and via social media. The targeted outreach consists of coming up with pro-<br/>grams to ameliorate specific weaknesses and reaching out through specific networks.&#160;<br/>For example, the Global Network of Centers provides a network that reaches into many&#160;<br/>parts of the world. &#160;The Center also identifies specific people who might be interested&#160;<br/>in applying.<br/>
Over the past five years, the Center has succeeded in raising the percentage of female&#160;<br/>fellows to 53% in the most recent cohort. Rebecca Tabasky, who was on the front lines&#160;<br/>of the effort, says, “Now we can say that we’ve achieved gender parity, which feels&#160;<br/>really good.”<br/>
The Center has likewise increased international representation, a priority of Executive&#160;<br/>Director Gasser, among others. The 2015-16 cohort has a significant number of fellows&#160;<br/>coming from Central and South America, and has made some gains in representation&#160;<br/>from Africa.<br/>
Rebecca Tabasky points to the often less-noticed diversity of purposes. Some fellows&#160;<br/>are aiming at careers as academics. Others are heading toward, or from, the business&#160;<br/>community, or are writing software or trade books. That means that if fellows share&#160;<br/>an interest in, say, privacy, they can collaborate unhindered by competitiveness. “The&#160;<br/>brass ring”—the prize they’re aiming at—“is different enough that they are happy if the&#160;<br/>other person gets their brass ring.”<br/>
The diversity of ideas and standpoints is of course also vital. The Center maintains a&#160;<br/>culture in which contrary ideas are welcome for open debate. As a community, however,&#160;<br/>it shares not only interests and norms of discourse, but also support for the potential of&#160;<br/>the Internet to promote values roughly aligned with those of secular Western education-<br/>al institutions such as Harvard: free inquiry, access to ideas, giving free reign to curios-<br/>ity, equal opportunity for each to flourish, and the power of collaboration. People with&#160;<br/>other views are of course read, discussed, and invited in to give talks.&#160;<br/>
This comes with the Center’s commitment to activism and to projects—software, ser-<br/>vices, events, organizations, etc.—that make a difference in the world. Primavera De&#160;<br/>Filippi, a fellow, puts it like this:<br/>
Fifteen Lessons from the Berkman Fellows Program<br/>
19<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=20></a>“You have people coming from different standpoints, but they share this common&#160;<br/>thread, which are the Berkman values. As you talk you understand that even though we&#160;<br/>come from different worlds, we are all trying to reach the same thing, and that’s where&#160;<br/>we stretch ourselves. We shouldn’t be all the same, but we also need not to be so differ-<br/>ent that there isn’t this beautiful mesh.”<br/>
The value of an open Internet crosses political lines. As Colin Maclay happily notes, “We&#160;<br/>invited in the head of the [George W.] Bush campaign’s technology platform, and he&#160;<br/>says, ‘I love hanging out with you guys. This is my tribe!”<br/>
Dan Gillmor, a former fellow, says, “The Center has a mission-oriented goal which&#160;<br/>involves making sure that the Internet and its potential will survive,” while also ensuring&#160;<br/>that contrary opinions are well represented.&#160;<br/>
Tabasky captures the balance when she poses the question that the Center constantly&#160;<br/>asks itself: “Are there other ways to bring in as much cohesive diversity as possible?”<br/>
Cohesive diversity.<br/>
<b>Provide just enough&#160;</b><br/>
<b>5</b><br/>
<b>structure</b><br/>
Berkman fellowships are offered to people who can be trusted to flourish in an atmo-<br/>sphere that gives them maximal freedom to explore. For this to happen, they have to&#160;<br/>“own their own experience,” as the program tells the incoming cohort. “You’re responsi-<br/>ble for making this experience work for you.”<br/>
The program nevertheless needs structure—just enough to serve as a platform to&#160;<br/>support them in their efforts. As Executive Director Gasser puts it, “The structure of the&#160;<br/>program remains a work in progress…which is a feature, not a bug.”<br/>
Around 2009 or 2010, when the number of fellows was growing, the leadership of the&#160;<br/>Center recognized that more structure was needed. The processes by which fellows&#160;<br/>were selected and brought onboard were reviewed by Executive Director Gasser, Man-<br/>aging Director Maclay, Community Manager Tabasky, and the Faculty Directors. There&#160;<br/>were retreats and focused discussions with staff, fellows, and others. From this came a&#160;<br/>more formal set of administrative structures. “We recognized we can draw some rules,”&#160;<br/>says Tabasky, “but they’re rarely going to be hard and fast. There will always be squish&#160;<br/>on the other side.” Then, more formally: “We didn’t want to be locked into those struc-<br/>tures.”<br/>

<a name=21></a>The fellows’ time is left quite unstructured, especially compared to other fellowship&#160;<br/>programs at Harvard and elsewhere. The only scheduled weekly meeting for fellows is&#160;<br/>the Tuesday afternoon Fellows Hour. What happens during it is left to each cohort, with&#160;<br/>guidance from returning fellows. Email messages are sent each week to the fellows to&#160;<br/>let them know what is on the agenda. Rebecca Tabasky also points out that this empha-<br/>sizes the importance of Fellows Hours.<br/>

Former fellow Ethan Zuckerman points to the way the culture has evolved especially af-<br/>
participant’s implicit will.<br/>
ter the Fellows Program was firmly established in the early 2000s. “Part of the success&#160;<br/>of this program,” he says, “is that it has developed cohorts that have felt empowered to&#160;<br/>build their own institutions and culture,” at times taking relatively sharp turns over the&#160;<br/>course of just a few years.<br/>
The Center recognizes that it’s important to maintain a balance of structure and open-<br/>ness. It errs on the side of openness.&#160;<br/>
There is no formula for this. As Faculty Chair Zittrain puts it, “You have to follow your&#160;<br/>nose.”<br/>
<b>6&#160;Get bodies in a room</b><br/>
Community is both a good in itself and an enabler for the sort of collaborative work that&#160;<br/>the Center favors. To enable community, the Center has concluded that some degree of&#160;<br/>residency has to be required.<br/>
In its very first days, the aim of the Fellows Program was to assemble a loose cohort of&#160;<br/>individual contributors, requiring residency would have been an obstacle: you wouldn’t&#160;<br/>get a John Perry Barlow to be a fellow if it meant abandoning his ranch. That of course&#160;<br/>changed as the program scaled up.<br/>
Even with its commitment to imposing minimal structure on the Fellows Program, the&#160;<br/>Center has embraced the residency requirement with enthusiasm because it builds&#160;<br/>community and enables the type of serendipity that only happens when two bodies find&#160;<br/>themselves seated next to each other at a table. As Prof. Zittrain says, “The more we&#160;<br/>can be in residence, the better.”<br/>
Although physical space at the Center is very limited, additional room has been created&#160;<br/>as open study areas. There is continuing debate among the fellows about whether those&#160;<br/>should be deemed quiet rooms or not, a debate that is likely to continue no matter how&#160;<br/>it is decided.<br/>
Fifteen Lessons from the Berkman Fellows Program<br/>
21<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=22></a>As the residential requirements have increased, the types of non-resident affiliations&#160;<br/>have as well. These currently include affiliates, faculty associates, and friends on the&#160;<br/>mailing list. “We do this to let non-resident folk shake up the conversation,” says Rebec-<br/>ca Tabasky, “and to maintain a wider network.”<br/>
One possible and unexpected benefit of the limitations of physical space: fellows have&#160;<br/>taken the initiative in the past few years to find ways to socialize outside of the Center,&#160;<br/>resulting in a lively social scene….<br/>
<b>Let the sociality&#160;</b><br/>
<b>7</b><br/>
<b>emerge</b><br/>
The Center provides many opportunities for social engagement. But over the past three&#160;<br/>years there has been a noticeable uptick in the social occasions Berkman fellows create&#160;<br/>for themselves. The mailing list for current fellows frequently has posts organizing ad&#160;<br/>hoc social events, including outings and dinners at fellows’ residences.&#160;<br/>
These events build a sense of community. They enable fellows to get to know one&#160;<br/>another better. They are an occasion for deeper dives into topics that might not be of&#160;<br/>more general interest. They enable a more personal discourse, with more risk-taking&#160;<br/>than public engagements make comfortable. They enable more inter-disciplinary, ser-<br/>endipitous discussions. They make people better collaborators.&#160;<br/>
This sociality arose organically. It is now part of the culture and has already been&#160;<br/>passed on from one cohort to another, primarily by the continuing fellows.<br/>

These are some of the groups created by fellows. Some have been going on for more&#160;<br/>than five years, their continuity provided by fellows who stay for more than one year.&#160;<br/>Some, like the Book Club, include former fellows years after their terms concluded.<br/>
The groups work differently, depending on the participants’ intents and interests. For&#160;<br/>example, here is how the Angry Tech Salon described itself in an email to the fellows:<br/>
ATS is a discussion group that attempts to encourage high quality conversation by&#160;<br/>putting theorists in contact with recent events. We pick a weekly theme, read academic&#160;<br/>papers and popular press articles, and talk about how they interrelate. The ‘angry’ in&#160;<br/>Angry Tech Salon is a joke. So is the ‘tech’ and the ‘salon’. We’re really in to: calming&#160;<br/>(critical?) conversations about contemporary culture.<br/>
Sara W and Tim M are the conveners, but generally every week someone new takes re-<br/>sponsibility for picking the readings and facilitating the discussion. Since this is the first&#160;<br/>week of Season Two, Sara &amp; Tim will take care of leading it and as a group we’ll pick out&#160;<br/>topics for the rest of the term. &#160;<br/>
Everyone is welcome. We ask only that you read the mandatory readings below.<br/>
The Cooperation Workshop, another highly successful group, is a bit more formal in its&#160;<br/>structure:<br/>
The Cooperation Workshop group is a small, user-driven forum for discussing empiri-<br/>cal research on cooperation. Several, but not all, of the participants are fellows at the&#160;<br/>Berkman Center.&#160;<br/>
Some weeks, we have seminar sessions which are public talks with an invited guest and&#160;<br/>will involve a presentation and a seminar discussion over about 75 minutes. They will&#160;<br/>be clearly marked below and advertised on a series of email lists.&#160;<br/>
Most of our sessions are workshop sessions where the basic model is that each week,&#160;<br/>one participant will distribute work for discussion and feedback from the group...<br/>
These groups enable interests to achieve a diversity, specificity, and depth beyond what&#160;<br/>

23<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=24></a>can be achieved in a Fellows Hour or Tuesday lunchtime discussion. Some of these&#160;<br/>groups achieve the intensity of a master class in a topic.<br/>
The staff provides the support that’s needed (within their capacity), and the existence&#160;<br/>of these groups is noted enthusiastically during the onboarding process. The fact that&#160;<br/>they originate with the fellows, and that the fellows take responsibility for running them,&#160;<br/>makes them even more important; they are very much the fellows’ own.<br/>
<b>9</b><br/>
<b>Build stuff</b><br/>
The commitment to building things—primarily software and organizations—goes back&#160;<br/>to the very origins of the Center. “Charlie [Nesson] emphasized that from the begin-<br/>ning,” says Prof. Zittrain, adding that it is a concrete way that the Center can have an&#160;<br/>impact. As fellow Sara Watson puts it, “The Berkman way is to say, ‘Let’s make some-<br/>thing happen,’ instead of just thinking about it or criticizing it.”&#160;<br/>
Building things has at least three benefits for the Center and the Fellows Program.<br/>
First, as early fellow Wendy Seltzer says, “There are lots of pieces of Internet research&#160;<br/>that can only be done by constructing things and seeing how they work.” She adds,&#160;<br/>with understatement, “That’s not always supported by academics. If it’s not a paper it&#160;<br/>doesn’t count in many other places.”<br/>
Second, selecting fellows in part for their ability to build things brings into the program&#160;<br/>people with deep technical understanding that grounds conversations in what is cur-<br/>rently practical and a realistic sense of what is achievable.<br/>
Third, building things attracts activists and researchers with activist leanings, enriching&#160;<br/>the mix.<br/>
<b>10&#160;Stand for something</b><br/>
“The Center is not going to take positions, and we embrace dissent.”&#160;<br/>
So states former Managing Director Colin Maclay. For example, during the days of the&#160;<br/>SOPA/PIPA debate that ultimately led to Google, Reddit, Wikipedia and other major&#160;<br/>sites “going dark,” the Center’s site stayed open. Indeed, there was vigorous debate&#160;<br/>among the fellows and the faculty about the meaning and wisdom of online copyright&#160;<br/>

The Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society does&#160;<br/>

not take an institutional position on matters of&#160;<br/>policy. However, it encourages its faculty, fellows,&#160;<br/>
recalling the founding days of the&#160;<br/>
staff, and community members to express their&#160;<br/>
Center, puts it in terms of justice:&#160;<br/>
viewpoints, and invites in-depth conversations on&#160;<br/>

groups to have the ability to ex-<br/>
informed analysis and to catalyze the expression of&#160;<br/>
press themselves and to connect&#160;<br/>
diverse opinions.<br/>

Consistent with this policy, the Berkman Center’s&#160;<br/>website is not dark today. Also consistent with&#160;<br/>

work should make a difference.<br/>
The Center recognizes that it is a tricky balance, but one worth striving for. Berkman’s&#160;<br/>commitment to building things entails making decisions about what to build based on&#160;<br/>their intended outcomes. But as an academic center, Berkman is also absolutely com-<br/>mitted to pursuing research regardless of the conclusions to which it may lead, as well&#160;<br/>as fostering respectful engagements with those who do not share its values. As Execu-<br/>tive Director Gasser puts it, “Yes, there is a set of broadly defined core values, but one&#160;<br/>of the core values is the openness and honesty to look at realities, to study them, and&#160;<br/>understand them.”&#160;<br/>
He points to two factors that help the Center find its balance. First, “The fellows are key.&#160;<br/>They keep us honest.” Second, “We shouldn’t forget the surrounding stakeholders: the&#160;<br/>foundations, donors, policy makers, NGOs, and partners—external voices who bring&#160;<br/>their issues to us. That creates another set of checks and balances.”<br/>

<a name=26></a><b>11&#160;Hire a remarkable staff</b><br/>
The Center hires staff who are not only highly competent, but who are cut from the&#160;<br/>same cloth as the fellows. Despite the staff count not keeping up with the growth of the&#160;<br/>fellows program, there has been remarkably little turnover.<br/>
Rebecca Tabasky points out, “there isn’t one full-time person whose sole responsibility&#160;<br/>is to mind the fellows.” Rather, she says, “it’s baked in to everyone’s responsibilities to&#160;<br/>consider the community and involve them in ways that make sense.”<br/>
The staff houses much of the institutional wisdom, including keeping up with the&#160;<br/>ever-growing informal network of former fellows. Amar Ashar, Manager of Strategic&#160;<br/>Initiatives, says it’s crucial to know who is working on what. “I make a concerted effort&#160;<br/>to talk with every fellow so I know what they’re doing.”<br/>
Tabasky began at the Center in 2006 as a staff assistant working at the front desk.&#160;<br/>Ashar began in 2007 as a Program Coordinator. Berkman’s commitment to staff respect&#160;<br/>and advancement are a critical part of maintaining a sense of continuity and involve-<br/>ment with the Center’s Fellows Program.<br/>

<b>Partner up</b><br/>
Fellows arrive with their own professional and personal networks. The emphasis on&#160;<br/>social bonding leads to an inevitable integration of these networks, which can be an&#160;<br/>important resource for fellows both during their term and afterwards.<br/>
The same happens at the institutional level. The Berkman Center has been an eager and&#160;<br/>supportive partner, working with other universities, non-profits, governmental agencies,&#160;<br/>commercial entities, and more.&#160;<br/>
This enables fellows to work on projects that the Center cannot support by itself and&#160;<br/>brings them into contact with people from a diverse range of backgrounds and ex-<br/>pertise. Indeed, the fellows are sometimes the partners: some are given fellowships&#160;<br/>because they are central to organizations and efforts the Center wants to partner with.<br/>
The Global Network of Centers (NoC) takes this spirit to a meta level by networking&#160;<br/>Internet research centers around the world. Formed at a 2012 meeting at the Berkman&#160;<br/>Center convened by Executive Director Gasser,8&#160; the NoC currently has more than fifty&#160;<br/>

<a name=27></a><b>13&#160;Be Harvard</b><br/>
The fact that the Berkman Center is at Harvard University bestows benefits. Most are&#160;<br/>replicable at least to some degree.<br/>
Harvard’s convening power is awesome, enabling projects that otherwise would be&#160;<br/>difficult, and bringing fellows into contact with leading voices from outside the pro-<br/>gram. But any fellows program has convening power, especially if it becomes known&#160;<br/>for putting on worthwhile events. Colin Maclay says, “When you ask someone what a&#160;<br/>Berkman event’s like, they say it’s fun, really smart people, engaging, unique.” That sort&#160;<br/>of reputation makes it much easier to get people to come to an event.<br/>
The Center has found it relatively easy to attract partners, undoubtedly in part due to&#160;<br/>the Harvard name. But none of those partnerships would have succeeded if the Cen-<br/>ter—and its fellows—had not been friendly, open, respectful, and a fun partner. These&#160;<br/>are qualities available to all centers, and for which Harvard has not always been noted.&#160;<br/>
Because of the Center’s origins at Harvard Law School, it has always enabled fellows&#160;<br/>to look at their work in light of policy. But every fellows program is embedded in an&#160;<br/>environment that has its own strengths. Former fellow Dan Gillmor advises, “What’s the&#160;<br/>unique advantage that your location has, including in expertise? Leverage that.”<br/>
Being part of Harvard means the Center has access to administrative resources that&#160;<br/>help it function at a high level. For example, the Center works with Harvard’s Interna-<br/>tional Office to secure visa paperwork for international community members. The pro-<br/>gram also benefits from University resources such as libraries, extracurricular opportu-<br/>nities, and the wider intellectual community.&#160;<br/>
Prof. Zittrain notes: “It helps to be at a major research university that culturally has a&#160;<br/>laissez faire attitude. There are a lot of rafters for the mice to run around in here.” Other&#160;<br/>centers can likewise strive to create open spaces in terms of expectations, norms, and&#160;<br/>structure.<br/>

<a name=28></a><b>Acknowledge your&#160;</b><br/>
<b>14</b><br/>
<b>issues</b><br/>
<b>Self-awareness is crucial</b><br/>
Staff and faculty engage in frequent discussions about the status and direction of the&#160;<br/>Center. Fellows are solicited for feedback at multiple times during their terms, and the&#160;<br/>openness of the Center to queries, suggestions, and criticism is stressed throughout.<br/>&#160;<br/>
<b>Scaling</b><br/>
As the Center has scaled up the number of fellows as well as the ambitiousness of its&#160;<br/>projects, it has experienced some growing pains.&#160;<br/>
Community bonding became more of an issue as the Fellows Program scaled. The Cen-<br/>ter addressed this by increasing the onboarding activities and creating more events at&#160;<br/>which the fellows can get to know one another. The self-generated fellows groups and&#160;<br/>social structures have also helped.&#160;<br/>
The growth in staff supporting the program overall (as opposed to staff supporting in-<br/>stitutional projects) has not been proportional to the increase in the number of fellows.&#160;<br/>A recent reorganization added some needed resources and structure.<br/>
Space has been at a premium. The Center started out as “smart people in a hallway,” as&#160;<br/>the lore has it. But if the Center had enough room for fellows’ offices and more common&#160;<br/>space, it would be transformed, quite possibly in positive ways: more conversation,&#160;<br/>more serendipity, more social groups, more social cohesion.<br/>
<b>Interaction with faculty</b><br/>
Fellows express satisfaction with the responsiveness of the faculty associated with&#160;<br/>Berkman: if you reach out to them, they will meet with you, and are helpful and sup-<br/>portive.&#160;But&#160;some&#160;of&#160;the&#160;fellows&#160;not&#160;tied&#160;directly&#160;to&#160;institutional&#160;projects&#160;have&#160;expressed&#160;<br/>disappointment that the faculty do not participate more frequently at the Center. (One&#160;<br/>faculty director also expressed concern about this.) &#160;The Center tries to address this&#160;<br/>when setting expectations for incoming fellows.<br/>
<b>Technical issues</b><br/>
Some fellows, like the proverbial cobbler’s children, think the Center could do better&#160;<br/>with the technology it uses to connect its physically dispersed members. At particular&#160;<br/>issue is the technology used to let off-site fellows participate in a video feed of Fellows&#160;<br/>Hours.<br/>
28<br/>
Fifteen Lessons from the Berkman Fellows Program<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=29></a>On the other hand, some of the fellows find that participation in Fellows Hours by those&#160;<br/>off-site is inherently disruptive; they would prefer that the meeting be open only to&#160;<br/>those who are physically present. The presence of offsite fellows is, in the words of one&#160;<br/>fellow, “disruptive to groupiness.”<br/>
<b>Funding</b><br/>
The Center’s inability to provide stipends to all but a few of the fellows inhibits its ability&#160;<br/>to attract less privileged applicants.&#160;<br/>
On the positive side, it means that many fellows have other fellowships or research ap-<br/>pointments, which enriches the conversational mix. That of course does not offset the&#160;<br/>negative effect on diversity among the fellows, or the ability of fellows to give their full&#160;<br/>share of mind to their fellowship project.<br/>
<b>Mismatched expectations</b><br/>
The Berkman Center’s consistent experience has been that no matter how carefully and&#160;<br/>repeatedly it sets the expectations of incoming fellows, they are all somewhat surprised&#160;<br/>by elements of the experience—most pleasantly, but some not so. This is the case even&#160;<br/>as the Center has purposefully ramped up its mechanisms for setting expectations,&#160;<br/>from the online materials, to the communications with applicants, to the multiple and&#160;<br/>varied onboarding events, to the interactions via the listservs, to the tone of all these&#160;<br/>interchanges.&#160;<br/>
In part this is because most incoming fellows have never been part of a fellows program&#160;<br/>before. In part it is because fellows programs are as unique as the schools that sponsor&#160;<br/>them and the cities that house them. In part it is because every cohort is different. In&#160;<br/>part it is because the Center encourages each year’s community to grow in emergent&#160;<br/>ways. In part it’s because human beings don’t all hear things the same way.<br/>
So expect to continue setting expectations, and to step in when it’s clear that false&#160;<br/>expectations are hindering a fellow’s success.<br/>

From the very inception of the&#160;<br/>
Berkman Center, the Fellows&#160;<br/>
Program has been core to the&#160;<br/>
Center’s vision.<br/>
The program has transformed itself several times, each iteration succeeding beyond&#160;<br/>expectations. There are, however, some constants:<br/>
A set of values consistent with the phenomenon the Center studies.<br/>
A culture that embodies those values.<br/>
A community that forms itself around that culture—but only because enormous atten-<br/>tion has been paid to enabling that community to form and reform every year.<br/>
A sense of perspective that remembers the human elements, including commitment,&#160;<br/>supportiveness, spontaneity, emergence, kindness, and fun.&#160;<br/>
A staff that is as committed to the values and pursuits of the Center as are the fellows&#160;<br/>they support.<br/>
A commitment to the hard work it takes to create an experience for fellows that is or-<br/>ganic and emergent. “It is a lot of work,” says Executive Director Gasser. “But it’s a truly&#160;<br/>collaborative project. It takes a lot of people who want to make this happen, and who&#160;<br/>come together to do the work and make their unique contributions.”<br/>

You should apply to be a Berkman Fellow next year, especially if you’re a designer, com-<br/>puter scientist, or researcher of technology. There’s one week remaining. Apply here.<br/>&#160;<br/>If you haven’t clicked on that&#160;<br/>link and started filling out the&#160;<br/>application, this blog post is&#160;<br/>for you. The official link has&#160;<br/>helpful information about&#160;<br/>qualifications, funding, and&#160;<br/>more. Here, I try to explain&#160;<br/>why makers, computational&#160;<br/>social scientists, and com-<br/>puter scientists should apply,&#160;<br/>even if you haven’t finished&#160;<br/>your PhD.<br/>
I’m a Berkman Fellow for the&#160;<br/>2013-2014 academic year.&#160;<br/>As a PhD student at the MIT&#160;<br/>Media Lab, I’m deeply enjoying the opportunity. This post tells my story, explains what&#160;<br/>I’m doing now, and answers questions you might have about being a Berkman Fellow.&#160;<br/>You should also know that is not official advice, and I’m not on the selection committee.<br/>
When I first arrived in Boston in 2011, I was starstruck and envious to learn that my&#160;<br/>colleague Molly Sauter had been Jonathan Zittrain’s research assistant. I haven’t fully&#160;<br/>overcome my shyness about chats with people who get lots of media attention, but I&#160;<br/>am learning to value what I bring to the conversation as a maker &amp; researcher. Over the&#160;<br/>last two years, Molly and my advisor Ethan encouraged me to visit Berkman events and&#160;<br/>blog them, which has been a fantastic learning experience. Molly also encouraged me&#160;<br/>to present my work-in-progress to the Cyberscholars working group, which I eventually&#160;<br/>came to co-facilitate.<br/>
In my two years as a Master’s student at the Media Lab,&#160;<br/>the inspiration and genuine encouragement of people&#160;<br/>at Berkman influenced major parts of my research. My&#160;<br/>presentation received amazingly helpful feedback and&#160;<br/>connections. A blog post I wrote from a talk by Andrés&#160;<br/>Monroy Hernández has inspired a long collaboration&#160;<br/>with Andrés and the first inklings of my PhD topic.<br/>
Berkman has been an astonishingly encouraging and&#160;<br/>positive community who have listened to me, respected&#160;<br/>

me, and supported me even as a random attendee at the public events. It’s a communi-<br/>ty of energetic curiosity, passionate action, and mutual support. Those are the qualities&#160;<br/>that motivated me to apply to be a Berkman fellow.<br/>
<b>What Do I Do At Berkman?<br/></b>In a given week, I spend all Tuesday at&#160;<br/>Berkman, concluding in a wonderful dinner&#160;<br/>conversation with other fellows. Since I’m&#160;<br/>based at MIT, I welcome fellows at the Media&#160;<br/>Lab and sometimes visit Berkman for a meet-<br/>ing or special event. I also try to make it to&#160;<br/>pub nights organised by other fellows. More&#160;<br/>formally, I:<br/>
<b>Co-facilitate</b>&#160;the cooperation working group with Brian Keegan. We read each oth-<br/>er’s papers, offer feedback on projects, review literature, and discuss new research&#160;<br/>on cooperation and peer production, every Tuesday at 5pm. Join us!<br/><b>Blog talks</b>&#160;and participate in discussions<br/><b>Participate&#160;</b>in the MediaCloud project in small ways by linking them up with re-<br/>searchers and contributing code from time to time<br/>With Kate, Andy, and Kit, we&#160;<b>created&#160;</b>a January term crash course for coders, start-<br/>ups, &amp; civic hackers to learn basics about legal issues &amp; concerns for makers.<br/><b>Link&#160;</b>Berkman fellows with networks &amp; resources in the Boston area, especially&#160;<br/>among makers and computer scientists. I connected one fellow with researchers&#160;<br/>who could offer insight on his upcoming startup. I am offering other fellows feed-<br/>back and suggestions on research methods. I host international experts to share&#160;<br/>their work at Berkman and enrich our connection to areas like computational social&#160;<br/>science (example).<br/>Occasionally&#160;<b>facilitate&#160;</b>transatlantic research partnerships and participate in conver-<br/>sations between researchers in the Berkman network and startups. I’m hardly the&#160;<br/>only person doing this kind of thing at Berkman.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<b>Q&amp;A<br/></b>Do You Have to Propose a Grand Project? Jeff&#160;<br/>Swift asked on Twitter about my driving proj-<br/>ect and next big thing for me. I don’t have one.&#160;<br/>Some of the fellows are working on their books&#160;<br/>or setting up their next startup. As a first-year&#160;<br/>PhD student, I’m building the network and&#160;<br/>
growing the conversation around the next four years of my work. Facilitation and net-<br/>work building are much less flashy, but they’re valued activities at Berkman.<br/>
Okay, but what are you actually working on? I’m finishing up work to measure gender&#160;<br/>representation in online media at a large scale. I’m continuing my work on acknowl-<br/>edgement online. I’m starting a research project on Space Teamwith the cooperation&#160;<br/>working group. I made a bot.<br/>
One of my year-long goals is to strengthen the role of technology makers, computer&#160;<br/>scientists, and computational social scientists at Berkman. Email me if you want to work&#160;<br/>together on something!<br/>

What do you wish you’d known before you applied? I already had a good understanding&#160;<br/>of Berkman before I applied. I think other fellows didn’t realise how much the fellowship&#160;<br/>is up to fellows themselves -- we create our own infrastructure, our own year program,&#160;<br/>and take responsibility for our own journey. Berkman usually doesn’t offer funds, can’t&#160;<br/>offer official Harvard access beyond libraries, and can’t usually sponsor visas. And yet&#160;<br/>the followship works amazingly well for people who invest time into the fellowship,&#160;<br/>articulate their interests, and take initiative with the conversations and resources avail-<br/>able.<br/>
<b>update 3 Dec:</b>&#160;Rebecca Tabasky writes, “we do sponsor visas for people who’re eligi-<br/>ble.”<br/>
<b>Berkman Patterns<br/></b>Here are some patterns I’ve observed while at Berkman:<br/>
• The Researcher uses Berkman to grow networks with practitioners, share ideas with&#160;<br/>people outside their field, and get feedback on new projects<br/>• Sociologists and Communications researchers often use this opportunity to connect&#160;<br/>more closely with tech research and develop as public intellectuals<br/>• Computer scientists often use this time to link their work with broader social and&#160;<br/>political issues and connect with companies that have interesting data<br/>• Humanities researchers use the Berkman network and experience with copyright to&#160;<br/>bring about new technologies and online resources<br/>• The Organisation Leader (or activist) uses a Berkman year to step back for some stra-<br/>tegic thinking, get feedback from researchers, connect with funders, and figure out the&#160;<br/>next thing<br/>• The Public Intellectual gets feedback from experts on upcoming projects, grows in&#160;<br/>visibility, builds networks, and develops new directions<br/>• The Mediamaker, often someone with a strong interest in Internet business models,&#160;<br/>copyright, or activism, takes time to reflect strategically and grow the next project<br/>• The Indie is someone who’s passionate about a set of values and skills and who works&#160;<br/>through Berkman as office space, a hub, and a network<br/>• The Institution Person connects with civil society, researchers, and companies to bring&#160;<br/>new perspectives to their work in government or other large institutions<br/>
Some people drop in and out as they can. Others focus on their main project. Some&#160;<br/>people bounce around looking for inspiration and collaborators. Others master the art&#160;<br/>of convening events. Many Berkman fellows catch up on their reading.<br/>
<b>What Makes Berkman So Special?<br/></b>It’s people. As a fellow, you’ll be part of an&#160;<br/>amazing, supportive network of people&#160;<br/>who will help you, challenge you, and work&#160;<br/>with you to make your work more socially&#160;<br/>conscious, more visible, more effective,&#160;<br/>and more awesome. If you’re excited to&#160;<br/>be that kind of person for someone else,&#160;<br/>and if you could use some of that yourself,&#160;<br/>apply now!<br/>

<a name=38></a>Appendix #4: Berkman ‘14<br/>On June 3, 2014, Sara Watson blogged about her experiences as a fellow.<br/><i>http://www.saramwatson.com/blog/the-year-at-berkman</i><br/>
<b>The Year at Berkman<br/></b>As the summer ramps up, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on some of the things&#160;<br/>that made my year at Berkman. At the risk of turning this into an exercise in namedrop-<br/>ping awesomeness, I thought it was worth sharing some of my favorites for posterity,&#160;<br/>linked where resources and recordings are available.<br/>
Defending an Unowned Internet and Intelligence Gathering and the Unowned Internet:&#160;<br/>In the year after Snowden, we had some very interesting conversations about how we’re&#160;<br/>supposed to think about the fundamental principles of the internet. Only at Berkman&#160;<br/>could you have two representatives, John DeLong and Anne Neuberger, from the NSA&#160;<br/>come to talk with Yochai Benkler, Jonathan Zittrain, and Bruce Schneier in a public fo-<br/>rum about their policies and practices in an effort to start an important cultural dialog.&#160;<br/>While the session was full of careful rhetoric (it was just as informative in what they did&#160;<br/>say as in what they didn’t), it was an important step towards opening up the conversa-<br/>tion.<br/>
Conversations: All kinds of people stop through Harvard and drop by Berkman to talk&#160;<br/>about their work and their latest burning questions about the internet. I got to par-<br/>ticipate in some of those conversations with Steve Ballmer, Travis Kalanick of Uber,&#160;<br/>Michael Fertik of Reputation.com, Scott Howe of Acxiom, and Aneesh Chopra. The&#160;<br/>intersection of industry and academia, of doing and thinking, is strong here, and it’s&#160;<br/>part of what makes Berkman a special place. These conversations gave me a better im-<br/>pression of what is top of mind in industry, but also exposed the points where my work&#160;<br/>could shift the conversation. I also learned a lot in presentations from Jillian McLaughlin&#160;<br/>on inappropriate uses of data broker data for scoring consumer credit risk, and Margot&#160;<br/>Kaminski on robotic surveillance. Lauren McCarthy’s lunch talk made me want to devel-<br/>op my own artistic and technical interventions.<br/>
Fellows Hours: Some of my favorite moments came from the conversations in fellows&#160;<br/>hours. I got to know my colleagues’ interests, and more often got the chance to engage&#160;<br/>with them about their work. One of my favorite sessions with Kate Darling and Camille&#160;<br/>François addressed the fuzziness of the definition of robots. David Weinberger led us&#160;<br/>through the earlier days of blogging, which raised some interesting questions about&#160;<br/>what it is to develop a voice in the age of Medium, Tumblr, and Twitter. Tim Maly shared&#160;<br/>some of his work in progress on the ethics of surveillance architectures and got us de-<br/>bating what makes a pair of jeans ethical. Fellows shared their networks and expertise,&#160;<br/>like the session Bruce Schneier ran on publishing models featuring editors from trade&#160;<br/>and academic presses who shared details on what they look for in a manuscript (tid-<br/>bit: even academic publishers aren’t excited to come across the “F word,” ie Foucault).&#160;<br/>Bruce also ran a great session on Op Ed writing skills, which proved immensely helpful&#160;<br/>and a bunch of peoplepublishedpieces as a result. Willow Brugh shared her technique&#160;<br/>and tools for visualization, and helped us think through an idea by fragmenting it&#160;<br/>visually. Amy Johnson and I also got to run a session on Progress Narratives and Moral&#160;<br/>Panics, which provided the chance for us to formalize our thinking and offered a new&#160;<br/>

<a name=39></a>frame for parsing how we talk about technology and change.<br/>
Camaraderie: I count many of my fellows as friends. Some clicked instantly, other&#160;<br/>friendships evolved through accumulated conversations and shared experiences. Over&#160;<br/>good food and drink, rotating fellows dinners offered the chance to get to know each&#160;<br/>other better, sometimes through performance as at Tim Davies’ Céilidh dinner. And I&#160;<br/>got to share my not-so-secret love of karaoke at the end of the year at Charlie’s Kitchen.&#160;<br/>Berkman became a supportive community of people I can count on to a read a draft of&#160;<br/>something I write before I post it, or to talk through a difficult decision and urge me to&#160;<br/>find my own voice. Parts of my work this year were challenging in unexpected ways, and&#160;<br/>I’m thankful to have had the support of this inspiring and encouraging group.<br/>
Being at Harvard: I really enjoyed returning to Harvard this year. I may be done with my&#160;<br/>degree, but you can’t take me out of school. I went back to things I wish I had done the&#160;<br/>first time around as an undergrad, exploring courses in the History of Science and the&#160;<br/>Science, Technology and Society departments here. These courses had a huge influ-<br/>ence on the way I think about current tech issues in a broader historical context and&#160;<br/>developed some of my constructivist instincts. They also confirmed my staunch devo-<br/>tion to interdisciplinary approaches. I also got to try my hand at teaching a couple guest&#160;<br/>seminars. There was no shortage of events to attend in the broader Cambridge commu-<br/>nity, including the Topics in Privacy series, sessions through the KSG like Julia Angwin’s&#160;<br/>book talk, and MIT events like Tarleton Gillespie’s CMS/W presentation on algorithms&#160;<br/>and the production of calculated publics. Having spent some time away, I’ve come to&#160;<br/>appreciate that the density and diversity of ideas here is like no place else.<br/>
Tech Book Club and Angry Tech Salon: I’ve heard people say that you get out of Berk-<br/>man as much as you are willing to bring to the table, and I think I hit my stride this&#160;<br/>spring. Tech Book Club has been going strong each month with a few core members,&#160;<br/>offering accountability to read books that we have been meaning to get to, and talking&#160;<br/>about the subjects and about the varied approaches to writing about technical topics.&#160;<br/>And Tim Maly and I also started Angry Tech Salon, which is developing into something&#160;<br/>of a space for pairing current events with theory, and seeing what happens as critical&#160;<br/>conversation unfolds each week.<br/>
This is just scratching the surface. There are countless moments that influenced me&#160;<br/>in smaller, subtler ways, and so many other wonderful events I didn’t made it to. So,&#160;<br/>consider this a completely subjective and inadequate attempt to express my gratitude&#160;<br/>for being part of this community this year. I’m looking forward to continuing as a fellow&#160;<br/>in the coming year!<br/>And with that, I will leave you with my interpretation of a dial-up modem, captured as a&#160;<br/>contribution to the Peak Fellows Hour scavenger hunt last week. The internet is serious&#160;<br/>business.<br/>

<a name=40></a>Appendix #5: Berkman ‘05<br/><i>In March 2005, David Weinberger, then a first year fellow, posted on his blog the fol-<br/>lowing description of the program. It is included as a viewpoint from before the Fellow-<br/>ship program had started scaling up to its present size.</i><br/>
<b>My life as a Berkperson<br/></b>I struggled to make this a hard-hitting piece that rips the lid off Harvard Law’s Berkman&#160;<br/>Center for the Internet and Society. But the fact is that I’m really happy here, and my&#160;<br/>fellowship was renewed before I published this. It’s a stimulating and kind environment.&#160;<br/>So, you’ll have to make up your own snarky comments.<br/>
Before I applied for a Berkman fellowship, I had to ask John Palfrey and Ethan Zuck-<br/>erman, neither of whom I knew, a whole bunch of damn fool questions. I had no living&#160;<br/>sense of what it meant to be a Berkman fellow. Do you drink sherry at 4? Just how witty&#160;<br/>is the banter? Would I get a discount on ascots?<br/>
I’ve been a fellow since July. Here’s what it’s like.<br/>
<b>Context<br/></b>The Berkman Center for the Internet and Society is a Center within Harvard Law. The&#160;<br/>professors affiliated with it are all with the Law School, and so are many of the students&#160;<br/>who take part in the various activities, but I find the overall interests have more to do&#160;<br/>with policy than law; I spend little of my time listening to lawyers discussing cases in an&#160;<br/>argot I don’t understand.<br/>
When you apply for a fellowship, you have to state what project you want supported,&#160;<br/>and that determines what your activities will be. The site lists five project areas, each&#160;<br/>prefixed with the word “open”: Law, governance, education, commerce and content.&#160;<br/>Some of the actual projects underway are:<br/>
Documenting Internet “filtering” (=censorship) by various governments<br/>Trying to increase international awareness in the blogosphere by facilitating&#160;<br/>“bridge bloggers”<br/>Encouraging and facilitating the growth of blogs in rights-challenged countries<br/>Aggregating information about all the groups aiming at establishing international&#160;<br/>governance of the Internet<br/>Building software to encourage classroom cross-discipline and cross-border con-<br/>versation<br/>The Digital Media Project, looking at the legal, social and economic effects of five&#160;<br/>possible “scenarios” describing the development of digital media tech and law<br/>
The Center combines research and advocacy, which is always a tough balance. While&#160;<br/>the Center doesn’t enunciate official stands on issues, it comes down consistently in&#160;<br/>favor of keeping the Internet an open space for ideas and innovation.<br/>
<b>What it’s like<br/></b>The Berkman Center has its own house, a three-story Victorian on Mass Ave a few&#160;<br/>blocks (but on a cold day, a very long few blocks) from Harvard Square. It’s a funky&#160;<br/>place, furnished with a dog pound of furniture, just the way your college apartment was.&#160;<br/>

<a name=41></a>There’s not a lot of space, so only a few people have offices there. The rest of us come&#160;<br/>in as appropriate and hang around the small-ish downstairs meeting room or perhaps&#160;<br/>grab a spare computer in a hallway or cranny. (You’ve gotta like a house with crannies.)&#160;<br/>I have a home office, so I don’t come into the Center to write. I come to hang out with&#160;<br/>people.<br/>
Last year, the Center started a new semi-policy: Tuesdays are fellows days. That’s&#160;<br/>the day to show up. In the morning, fellows hang out in the downstairs meeting room&#160;<br/>around a table. There are bagels, fruit and coffee, and no topic. It’s usually only a hand-<br/>ful of us. I think I most see Rebecca MacKinnon, Ethan Zuckerman, Zephyr Teachout,&#160;<br/>Mary Rundle, Derek Bambauer, Henrik Schneider andWendy Koslow there. There’s&#160;<br/>never a problem getting a conversation going. Jezoos Carruthers, I learn a lot.<br/>
Most Tuesdays there’s a lunchtime speaker. It’s in the same small room, often with an&#160;<br/>overflow crowd of twenty or so. The speakers range pretty much all over the lot, from&#160;<br/>a Microsoft lawyer talking about copyright to a report on connectivity in Uzbekistan.&#160;<br/>Typically the speaker doesn’t get through her presentation entirely. The Center provides&#160;<br/>sandwiches.<br/>
Tuesdays are the most structured, but any day of the week you will find interesting&#160;<br/>people from whom you will learn gobs. Plus, there are speakers, meetings and get-to-<br/>gethers at random times.<br/>
<b>What you have to do<br/></b>Each fellow is expected to present her research at a Tuesday lunch or equivalent and to&#160;<br/>write something for the Center’s journal. The rest of your duties are determined by the&#160;<br/>project the Center is supporting.<br/>
My case is a bit unusual because my project — working on a book about the effect the&#160;<br/>digital organization of stuff is having on the nature of knowledge (I really have to find a&#160;<br/>more interesting way of describing it) — is a bit off-topic for the Center. So, I’m sup-<br/>posed to work on the book and also lead a series of Wednesday night discussions.<br/>
Fellowships are usually for one year.<br/>
<b>What you get</b><br/>
A stipend that ranges from $0 to $42,000. (I’m way at the low end of the scale,&#160;<br/>and certainly need to keep my day job.)<br/>A Harvard ID that lets you use just about any of its resources<br/>A Harvard business card that impresses the hell out of people<br/>The opportunity to participate in the life of the Center<br/>No parking privileges<br/>
<b>The Culture<br/></b>I’ve been in a variety of academic environments, and the Berkman is the most collegial&#160;<br/>of them. Much of that is due to the personalities of the law professors in charge. The&#160;<br/>Center’s first instinct, in my limited experience, is to support you in your project or&#160;<br/>line of thought. There is an air of sweetness about the Center, which I did not expect.&#160;<br/>I mean, these are Harvard law professors. Didn’t they see The Paper Chase, fer pete’s&#160;<br/>sake?<br/>

<a name=42></a>The Center is multi-partisan in theory. In practice, the Center’s heart is clearly&#160;<br/>pro-grassroots. It’s unlikely to file a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the RIAA. (If&#160;<br/>you’re from the RIAA and give a lunchtime talk, you’ll be treated with respect, but you’ll&#160;<br/>also be asked tough questions by Harvard lawyers.)<br/>
I personally love the mix of scholarship and activism. These are folks passionate about&#160;<br/>the Internet both intellectually and practically. And it’s a “learning community”: I have&#160;<br/>yet to be laughed at (to my face, anyway) for asking dumb questions. The ethos is one&#160;<br/>of generosity: People will spend forever helping me to understand things.<br/>
I see more women there than men.<br/>
<b>Negatives<br/></b>The gender balance feels about right in practice among the fellows (yes, I’m aware&#160;<br/>of the irony of using the word “fellows” in this sentence), although it’s way off at the&#160;<br/>professorial level. And the atmosphere is definitely not one of macho competition and&#160;<br/>oneupmanship. There’s a fair bit of international presence, and most discussions occur&#160;<br/>within a global perspective. The racial balance sucks.<br/>
It is an academic environment, which often informs the discourse. If that’s not your cup&#160;<br/>of tea, then the Berkman Center is probably not for you. It is, however, also an activist&#160;<br/>center. I like the balance. You may not.<br/>
The range of political and policy opinions among the fellows is fairly narrow. More&#160;<br/>diversity would help.<br/>
I’m having trouble coming up with other negatives. (Oy, that sentence sits there like&#160;<br/>bait!)<br/>
<b>In Conclusion<br/></b>If you can’t tell, I’m enjoying my time as a Berkperson. I’m meeting people I care about&#160;<br/>and, unsurprisingly, you can’t hardly walk through the doors without falling into a con-<br/>versation that changes the way you think. What more could I ask for? Besides a parking&#160;<br/>space.<br/>
